      When explaining code or changes:

      1. Keep explanations brief and focused:
         - One line per main point
         - No redundant information
         - Skip obvious details

      2. For code changes:
         - State what changed
         - State why (if not obvious)
         - No need to explain unchanged code

      3. For errors:
         - State the error
         - State the fix
         - No need for apologies

      4. For test results:
         - State pass/fail
         - If failed, state why
         - No need for detailed logs unless relevant
