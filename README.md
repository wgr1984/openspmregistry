Simple (using as much go std. lib and as less external dependencies as possible) implementation of Swift Package Manager Registry according to
https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-package-manager/blob/main/Documentation/PackageRegistry/Registry.md

# Current Features
Basic Publishing and retrieval of swift packages
- ✔️ Listing / Browsing
- ✔️Retrieval of Packages
- ✔️ Publishing
  - ✔️ synchronous
  - ✔️ binary format
  - ✔️ Support Signatures
  - ✔️ support metadata block
- ✔️ Storage
  - ✔️ Filesystem
  
# How To Use
## Run server
### Using docker image
TBD
### From source
fetch from git
```
git clone https://github.com/wgr1984/openspmregistry.git
```
build / run
```
 go run main.go -tls=true -v
```
⚠️ check `server.yml` to e.g. adapt path and port
```
 go run main.go -tls=true -v
```

## Usage in SPM
### Create New Project
https://www.swift.org/documentation/package-manager/
e.g.
```
mkdir spm_test
cd spm_test
swift package init --type=executable 
```
ensure spm registry is known and setup
e.g. `localhost` (be ware `swift package-registry` as for now accepts tls/ssl connections only)
```
swift package-registry set https://127.0.0.1:1234
```
⚠️ on local setup we need to make sure ssl cert is set too trusted on system level
